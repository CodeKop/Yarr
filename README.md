# FlutterRoad

Unofficial RoyalRoad client for iOS and Android.

## Introduction

This started as a first project for me in Flutter, going in blind. RR doesn't have an app (yet), so it was a great opportunity. You can browse the top trending, popular, and highly rated fictions as well as search for fictions, as well as change the font size, type, and dark/light mode. Further development will be to convert the project to use proper design patterns. An app-based library and progress feature may be in scope in the future, but I am unsure if login/follow list/reading progress updates with a RR account are in scope.
