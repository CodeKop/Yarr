Unofficial RoyalRoad client for iOS and Android.

## Introduction

This started as a first project for me in Flutter, going in blind. RR doesn't have an app (yet), so it was a great opportunity. You can browse the top trending, popular, and highly rated fictions, read chapter comments, search for fictions, and even change the font size, type, and dark/light mode. Further development will be to convert the project to use proper design patterns. An app-based library and progress feature may be in scope in the future, but I am unsure if login/follow list/reading progress updates with a RR account are in scope.

## Getting Started

### Install

For development:

```bash
cd royalroad_api && pub get
cd .. && flutter pub get
```

For just getting it running:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Run

```bash
flutter run
```
